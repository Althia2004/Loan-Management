## ðŸ“± Payment Information in QR Code

```json
{
  "merchant": "Money Glitch Cooperative",
  "merchantId": "MGLITCH2024",
  "amount": 4375.00,
  "reference": "LOAN-LOAN20251006211221",
  "description": "Loan Payment for LOAN20251006211221"
}
```

## ðŸ”’ Security Features

- Authentication required (JWT token)
- Only shows user's own loans
- Validates payment amounts

## ðŸ“Š Test Results

âœ… Althia Grace Discaya has 1 active loan available
âœ… Monthly Payment: â‚±4,375.00
âœ… Remaining Balance: â‚±52,500.00
âœ… QR code generation ready
âœ… All features functional

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

The payment dashboard is now live and ready to use at:
**http://localhost:3000/payments**

Note: Actual payment processing would need to be integrated with GCash's official API. Currently, the QR code contains the payment information in JSON format that can be extended to match GCash's actual QR format when integrating with their payment gateway.
